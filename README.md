# AILearnsToPlayContraIII

## Overview

This project focuses on training an artificial intelligence (AI) agent to play the classic video game Contra III: The Alien Wars on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). Leveraging reinforcement learning algorithms, OpenAI Baselines, and innovative reward strategies, the AI navigates diverse enemy scenarios and conquers challenging boss battles.

## Key Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:**
  - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO2)
  - Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):**
  - Integration for enhanced learning
- **Dynamic Reward Function:**
  - Factors in distance traveled, increased lives, penalties for deaths, and specific rewards for sub-bosses
- **In-depth Metrics Analysis:**
  - Entropy, episode rewards, episode length, value loss, explained variance, and more
